int main(){
    
}/* readBlock() reads an entire block 
of BLOCKSIZE bytes from the open disk
 (identified by ‘disk’) and copies the 
 result into a local buffer (must be at 
 least of BLOCKSIZE bytes). The bNum is a 
 logical block number, which must be 
 translated into a byte offset within 
 the disk. The translation from logical to
  physical block is straightforward: bNum=0 is 
  the very first byte of the file. bNum=1 is
   BLOCKSIZE bytes into the disk, bNum=n is
    n*BLOCKSIZE bytes into the disk. On success,
it returns 0. -1 or smaller is returned if 
disk is not available (hasn’t been opened) or
any other failures. You must define your own
 error code system. */
